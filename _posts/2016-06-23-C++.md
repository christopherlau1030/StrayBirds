##Chapter 1
###cerr can be used to output warning and errors.
###clog can be used to output information of the program.
###endl has the ability to end this line and make the content in the buffer go to the equipment.
###+= equals an add and an assignment.
###when istream is considered as a condition of if or while, it ends when meet a valid input or ^D or ^Z.
###when the program is compiled, in the command window we can type $ programname <infile >outfile. It means the program would read the data from the infile and output the data in the outfile.
###Btw, I also learned that --val means minus first while val-- means minus after. For example, cout<<10--<<endl would output 10. But cout<<--10<<endl would ouput 9.
