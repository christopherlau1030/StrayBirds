##Chapter 4
###Operator can be divided into unary operator and binary operator. The unary operator includes &,* and so on.
###Operator can be rvalue or lvalue.
###Bool type should better not be involved in calculation.
###For && operator, the right condition would be calculated only when the left condition is TRUE. Same for the || operator, the right condition would be calculated only when the left condition is FALSE.
###ptr->mem equals (*ptr).mem Remeber the () should not be missed.
### Under normal circumstances, ++i is better than i++. Simply, i++ would return i rather than i+1. However, i is changed but it returns the old one. Therefore, i++ should not be used unless we have a special requiremet.
###Cond?expr1:expr2; is considered to be a better judging operator than if...else... for it can pass the exp2 only if the exp1 is right.
###sizeof can be used to measure the size of something. Usage:sizeof (type); sizeof expr;
